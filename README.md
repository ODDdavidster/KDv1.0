# Kiosk Doom

The Goal of this project is to allow a game shop to have many versions of doom available to his customers without requiring 20 different executables or a "confusing" doom launcher.

The newest realices of Ultimate Doom and DoomII from steam are a requirment as of now. I will make it so that this can be set up from a folder instead very soon. 

Python 3.0 and up are required to run this. Please install it from [here.](https://www.python.org/)

Extract the file `KDv1.0.zip` to a folder you want it to run from and then run `install.py`
